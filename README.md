 This project deals with the Movie Application which allows the user to view, Add,Edit and delete the movie details which exist in the database.Master  page consits of already added details which has two options Edit and Add , based on the user click the page redirects to Editpage or viewpage. In edit page I have given a form to be filled where all the fields are mandatory , As soon as user edits the data and submit it the changes are reflected in master page.On the add button click the page redirects to Add database webpage where once again a form needs to be filled , If all the data entered is already there in database it wont create a duplicate row, throws an error.
 
 This entire Application is developed in ASP.NET using visual studio 2015 , database consits of 5 colums as follows id,producer, Movie name , Release date and actor where id is set as the primary key its just the sequence of row. Producer is of varchar datatype(100) same applies for movie name and actor . Release data is of datetime type.
