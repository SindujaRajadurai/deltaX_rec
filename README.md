 This project deals with the Movie Application database CRUD function,
 I have added the below validations,
 Movie name , Release date , Producer and Actor names cant be blank when you are creating a record.
 In the view page editing isnt allowed
 If all the data entered is already there in database it wont create a duplicate row, throws an error.
 While editing none of the field values cant be blank.
 In the view page edition isnt allowed.
